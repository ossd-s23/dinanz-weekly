Some information about you!

### More Information

My name is Diana Zhao and I'm a senior in CS. I've taken four courses with Prof. Klukowska now (I'm sorry if I don't quite remember if the prof mentioned not liking us using her last name...) and the first two courses I did abysmally in, but the last course I took with her last semester was okay, and I intend for this course to go okay as well.
Anyway in my free time I like to play video games, listen to music, work out, and do some art or writing. Anything that relieves stress I guess.
I want to be a software engineer, and I'm currently revising full stack app dev so I can start on a personal project that I've been wanting to do.
