title: Week 1:

I have always been interested, or curious, about open source development. I think of open source projects as a collaborative process where many like-minded people who share similar interests and goals come together, putting their different or similar skills sets to use, complementing each others' skills to build something that they are all working towards. I think open source is just about the best thing to ever exist, not just open source development but things like Wikipedia especially. I guess one could argue that the entire internet is kind of open source? I think that this infinite shared knowledge is the best thing to happen since the internet was invented.
<br>I think that there are definitely disadvantages to open source, such as with open source code, if someone pushed some code with malicious content and whoever merged it wasn't careful enough, it could cause problems. Or the merger could realise the problem but it would still be a waste of time for that person. Also, with things like Wikipedia, the fact that anyone has edit access is also a big issue, which is also why Wikipedia is not a credible source, even if it is a good source of knowledge.
<br>Closed source would not have any of these issues, but would also lose the benefits of having a massive team of sincere members working on it as a community.
<br>I became interested in open source and this class because I currently have a few project ideas in mind, however I do realise that I do not have the skill nor time to make them happen as one person. So I am hoping that one day I can start my own open source project and encourage others to join.
<br>A few open source projects I am interested in and frequently use are [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and [Python](https://www.python.org/). It is interesting how blender, a popular 3D modeling software, is free and open source. It is apparently not the industry standard software, but it definitely is the most popular 3D software amongst hobbiests. I am very interested in 3D modeling and redering - which almost made me take the computer graphics course this semester but never got off the waitlist - and so blender is something that interests me as an open source project. Wikipedia, as I've said, is the best website ever. Git and Python of course I use regularly as a CS student, however I'm not too familiar with the open source aspects of these two.
